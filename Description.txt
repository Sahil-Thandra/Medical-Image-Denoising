In this project a deep learning based model is proposed for medical image denoising using convolutional denoising autoencoders. Two datasets, mini-MIAS database of mammograms(MMM) and a dental radiography database(DX) are used. These datasets are pre-processed and corrupted with gaussian noise. These corrupted images are used as inputs to the convolutional autoencoder model. The resulting images were compared with the original images using structural similarity index measure (SSIM) for the consistency and accuracy of the model. Experiments verify the advantages of the model compared with NL means and median filter method.
